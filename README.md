👋 Hi, I’m @AhmadRandhawaOfficial
👀 I’m interested in problem-solving, and I chose programming to tackle challenges.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python, focusing on game development and machine learning.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source Python projects, especially in machine learning to build my skill set.

⚡ Fun fact: I started programming in July 2024, so I’m still a junior here. It’s a pleasure to learn from seniors in the community. Currently, I’m exploring data visualization
using the Matplotlib library and recently completed my first game project in Pygame called "Alien Invasion." I’d be happy to share the code if you ask!
